# ruby_shell_example
Bare bones example of a ruby shell

I gave a talk about creating a ruby shell on March 13, 2019 at Indy.rb (https://www.meetup.com/indyrb/).
This is the code I used in the talk.

## Usage
To boot up the shell, simply call `ruby shell.rb` from the root of this project.

To exit, either type `quit` or CTRL+d

Disclaimer: this shell only supports like 60% of the cool features of the ruby language.
